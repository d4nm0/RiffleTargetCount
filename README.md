# Riffle Target Count

it's a python program to count the points on his sport shooting target, for the moment it works only with one type of target


## Roadmap

- fix the bug that makes it not count the impact when it is on the point line
- Add my own shooting targets that I use when I shoot 
- Adding other target types
- Potentially create a mobile app or web interface that communicates with the script to take a picture of the target 
- add the possibility that the user points this impact on the target if they are not detected

I have an example with one of my targets from last Saturday. The script reacts rather badly. The photo was not taken straight up, I took it from above so it must have been an extra effort for the script.
