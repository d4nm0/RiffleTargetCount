# Riffle Target Count

it's a python program to count the points on his sport shooting target, for the moment it works only with one type of target


## Roadmap

- fix the bug that makes it not count the impact when it is on the point line
- Add my own shooting targets that I use when I shoot 
- Adding other target types
- Potentially create a mobile app or web interface that communicates with the script to take a picture of the target
